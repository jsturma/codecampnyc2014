Session Title	Session Level	Session Abstract
Will The ReAL ReST Please Stand Up?	200	This is not meant to be a "You're not ReSTful, I Am" type of session, it's merely meant to inform. I built "ReSTful-ish" services for a long time, and sometimes that's good enough. But I missed out on some of the benefits of REALLY ReSTful APIs and, specifically, the hypermedia aspects of the ReST proposal. In this session we will talk about Dr. Fielding's dissertation and the benefits of adhering to the proposal of Representational State Transfer, and when pragmatism should win.
Good agile, Bad Agile.	200	There's been a lot of talk recently about Agile software development. As people try to make the transition, they generally find themselves stumbling and maybe even giving up on Agile altogether. In this session we will discuss what Agile is, and what it isn't. Most importantly how to chose the "flavor" that is right for your organization, and how to get started.
Developer Level-Up	200	You've been writing software for a little while now, and feel like you're missing that vital piece (or pieces) that will get you to that next level. We'll talk about the things that high-level (read highly paid) software developers do that helps them to: stay ahead of the trends, find their niche, make themselves known and manage their personal brand. If you're a junior or mid-level developer looking to level-up your career, this is the session.
A Whirlwind Tour of Xamarin	100	Xamarin allows C# developers to target multiple platforms with the language and tools they love. Whether you’re looking to build cross-platform mobile applications targeting iOS and Android or if you are hoping to build the next great Mac application, Xamain has you covered. In this session, I’ll briefly cover where Xamarin came from (believe it or not it has been around since 2009!) and where it’s heading before launching into a tour of its features and workflows. I’ll show you how to use Xamarin Studio and Visual Studio to build iOS and Android applications. You’ll leave with enough knowledge to decide for yourself (or convince your boss!) that Xamarin is right for your project.
Using Xamarin.Forms to Create Cross-Platform Apps	100	Xamarin.Forms is an exciting new feature of the Xamarin platform that enables developers to target multiple mobile UI platforms from a single codebase. Code written for the user interface of the application will be translated to the proper native controls for the target platform. In this session, I'll introduce you to the basics of Xamarin.Forms. I'll also show some of the extensibility points that will make it possible for you to create your own Xamarin.Forms controls. You'll leave with the knowledge necessary to create native cross-platform apps that have a maximum level of code re-use.
Creating Single Page Applications with Ember.js	100	Ember.js is a new client-side application framework that makes it very easy to get a lot accomplished with very little code.  Once you understand the basics of how Ember.js handles MVC (it's a little different from server-side MVC!) and routing, you will enjoy the productivity boosts the framework offers you.  In this session I'll introduce you to Ember.js basics, how to handle data, and how to use Handlebars templating to build your application.  Upon leaving the session, you'll be ready to join Groupon and Square and many other companies using this hot new framework! 
What Have I Done?!	100	Do you have trouble staying focused on the task at hand?  Have you ever made it to 11AM and realized the only thing you have accomplished is reading emails and checking up on Twitter?  If so, you may just need to introduce some simple hacks into your lifestyle.  In this session, I'll discuss some very easy to implement tips and tricks that can help jolt you from unproductive and wandering through your day to a more focused and in control lifestyle.
Front End Design Patterns: SOLID CSS + JS for Backend Developers	100	As backend developers, we spent years perfecting and implementing the various patterns we use. These patterns allow us to exploit previous pain and experience, resulting in improved robustness of our code and increased efficiency of the coding process. At the same time we are finding it harder and harder to avoid working in the browser, and making unique and compelling end user experiences. With the experience we now have with client, similar benefits of using design patterns can be gained here.  Join Anthony van der Hoorn, as we look at what design patterns exist on the client and how we can use them. Once you know what patterns are at your disposal, you will start writing better code, that's more maintainable and easier to read.
Beyond NuGet: Front End Package Management with Bower	100	ackage managers are becoming a way of life. For years now we have been using NuGet and have gained significant benefits within our applications and development process. That said, most of these benefits have trended towards server side improvements, rather than client side ones. Even though client focused packages do exist NuGet, they have never really been at home.  Join Anthony van der Hoorn, as we look at what solutions have taken off in the front end development community for package management. We will be looking closely at Bower, NPM and more. We will see how these can be used within our existing .Net projects and what the differences are between NuGet and these other options.
Modern Web Diagnostics with a Glimpse into ASP.NET	100	With the state of diagnostics on the web being what it is, we currently have to do a job that is much harder than it should be. Too often, the tools we are provided with only show a small part of the picture, leaving us to guess what else might be happening behind the scenes. Glimpse is an open source project that aims to change the way we think about diagnostics and the frameworks we interact with.   After releasing Glimpse at Mix 11, Glimpse has become a tool that is used daily by tens of thousands of developers around the world. In this session, youíll learn how to use Glimpse to reveal a complete picture of what is happening within your ASP.NET MVC and WebForms sites, discover what tools are included out of the box, and see how you can easily extend it to suit your needs.
Full Stack Web Performance	200	Modern users expect more than ever from web applications. Unfortunately, they are also consuming applications more frequently from low bandwidth and low power devices – which strains developers not only to nail the user experience, but also the application’s performance.  Join Nik Molnar, co-founder of the open source debugging and diagnostics tool Glimpse, for an example-driven look at strategies and techniques for improving the performance of your web application all the way from the browser to the server.  We’ll cover how to use client and server side profiling tools to pinpoint opportunities for improvement, solutions to the most common performance problems, and some suggestions for getting ahead of the curve and actually surpassing user’s expectations.
Introducing Nonacat (Guerilla Hacking an Extra Arm onto GitHub)	100	GitHub, as instrumental as it is, knows that they cannot possibly offer a one-size-fits-all service that meets the needs to every OSS project. With that in mind, come join Nik Molnar, co-founder of Glimpse, for a session on how to extend GitHub by leveraging their API’s, cutting edge web technologies and free/open source tools to provide users, contributors and project maintainers with a better overall experience.  This session is not about Git itself and is suitable for OSS project maintainers and all users of GitHub.
Azure Web Sites Secrets, Exposed!	100	Microsoft’s premier cloud solution for custom web applications, Windows Azure Web Sites, has brought the DevOps movement to millions of developers and revolutionized the way that servers are provisioned and applications deployed.  Included with all the headline functionality are many smaller, less-known or undocumented features that serve to greatly improve developer productivity. Join Microsoft MVP and veteran web developer Nik Molnar for a whirlwind tour of these secret features and enhance your cloud development experience. 
How to be a Six Figure Developer	300	Software and website developers are in extremely high demand and rates continue to climb, but many developers have not yet realized their potential. In this talk we lay out some simple and proven ways to measure your accomplishments, establish a personal brand, and increase your value to employers.
Application Services Governance	100	API Management and SOA Governance are converging into a consolidated space called Application Services Governance. In this session we will provide an overview of these concepts and illustrate how they can provide agility, cost efficiency, risk management and stability for your company.
Build a MVC5 eCommerce Site in 5 Minutes	200	For those of us who have spent most of our careers building business applications, the prospect of creating an e-commerce storefront can be quite daunting. Not only do you have to deal with calculating tax, estimating shipping and accepting payments, but employees need a way to manage products, discounts and marketing content. Thankfully, there's an open source e-commerce solution written in Microsoft ASP.NET MVC5 named nopCommerce that provides all this functionality and much more. I was so impressed by both the functionality and the underlying architecture that I've created a presentation which I believe will serve as a great introduction to MVC as well as a tutorial on developing custom storefronts using nopCommerce. We start off with a brief overview of basic MVC concepts accompanied by examples within the nopCommerce code. This includes strongly typed Razor views, HTML helpers, jQuery ajax calls, and fluent validation. Once everyone understands how the website works, we dive into the infrastructure by introducing WCF services, using a generic repository with Entity Framework(EF4) and LINQ, as well as Dependency Injection (DI) with Automapper.
Introducing ASP.NET vNext – The Future of .NET on the Server	200	In this session, ASP.NET MVP Jeff Fritz will introduce you to the next version of ASP.NET.  He will show you how Microsoft is decoupling ASP.NET, making it easier to build modular applications.  We’ll see how the world of NuGet and lightweight VMs enable you to build faster and simpler web applications.  This session will change the way you look at ASP.NET, and you’ll be ready for the next generation of web development, today.
Build your first mobile app with Cordova and Telerik AppBuilder	200	Mobile has taken over, and you are still programming a line of business application for your employer. How can you get started building a mobile application that will run on your favorite device without learning a brand new programming language and getting involved with device vendors? In this session, I will introduce Apache Cordova (Adobe Phonegap) and the Telerik AppBuilder product. You will learn how to leverage your HTML5 and JavaScript skill set to build applications that will run on any iOS, Android, or Windows Phone device and can be uploaded to any store.
Mobile ASP.Net Web Forms - Making the impossible possible	200	In this session, I will show you how to take your bland ASP.Net web application and make it available in a form factor for mobile browsers without re-writing your entire application.  I will also show you how to scale your application for tablets, and handle all of the functionality in a DRY manner.  Key take-aways from this session will include: * Ability to adapt your existing application to handle phone and tablet screen sizes * Ability to re-use logic in your current application in new form factors * Knowledge and comfort around testing your web application for various device screen sizes
Cool, Elegant, and Practical ASP.Net Web Forms	200	More than 10 years after the initial release of ASP.Net, the web forms framework is still alive and kicking butt.  I’ll show you the latest features and tricks that are available when creating web applications with ASP.Net web forms 2012.2  I’ll also show you some of the beta tools that are available, including the new web forms scaffolding engine.  Attendees will learn to leverage all of the latest tools to make their coding experience simpler, shorter, and more enjoyable.
Take Your ASP.NET Web Forms to the SPA	200	In 2014 JavaScript has taken over the web and is a factor in how we build and deliver web applications. This session will show you how to start using these modern JavaScript libraries like Modernizr, Knockout, and Angular to make your web forms application feel faster and better on mobile devices. We&rsquoll bring modern single-page-application architecture into a legacy web forms application and refresh our application in place, without distracting from the existing featureset.  *Developers will be introduced to several modern JavaScript tools including Angular and GruntJS *Developers will learn how to use JavaScript libraries to migrate their application to a compelling client-side experience with their existing web forms applications
An Introduction to Visual Studio Online	100	Visual Studio Online (VSO) is a cloud-based version of Visual Studio Team Foundation Server (TFS). Like TFS, with VSO, you can management your Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) process which includes source code control, team collaboration, agile development practices, work item management & continuous integration via automated builds. Unlike TFS, with VSO, you don’t need to worry about installation and configuration because VSO is a PaaS offering in Microsoft Azure.  This session introduces you to VSO’s fundamentals so that you can immediately begin working with VSO to make your ALM efforts more productive.
Introduction to Javascript Unit Testing	200	JavaScript is increasingly taking on a more prominent role in .NET-based applications. In spite of that, JavaScript testing is not a discipline that is widely embraced. An often cited reason is that it is very difficult to write well organized and testable JavaScript code. If you have struggled with JavaScript, John will introduce you to techniques and tools that will make it easier for you to write testable JavaScript code and JavaScript Tests. John will introduce you to two tools: 1 - the jQuery QUnit JavaScript unit testing library and 2 - sinonJS, which is a JavaScript mocking library. John has created a custom Visual Studio project template that has been optimized to make writing and running JavaScript tests in Visual Studio as easy as writing other unit tests. 
  High Speed Entity Framework with ASP.NET MVC	200	  The latest version of Entity Framework introduced significant improvements to the point that Entity Framework is now the unquestionable ORM of choice for .NET developers. In this fast paced session, we start with a simple application built using ASP.NET MVC 5 and Entity Framework 6. We will evolve that application to show some common pitfalls and explore solutions that illustrate how we can support real world scenarios and build high performance, scalable web applications. Topics covered will include database initialization, async queries, performance profiling, performance tuning and connection pooling. 
  Modern Web Development with Visual Studio 2013 and Web Essentials	200	In this action packed session, we will take a tour of the tools available for modern web developers in Visual Studio 2013 and Visual Studio Web Extensions.  JSHint, LESS, SASS, CoffeeScript, JSLint, Angular, Minification, Bundling, Markdown, Node.js, Chrome, FireFox and much more: The depth and breadth of functionality available is likely to surprise you. 
Messaging Patterns in Microsoft Azure	200	There are numerous reasons why asynchronous messaging should be introduced in applications, as well as many approaches in incorporating messaging subsystems.  In some cases intensive workloads need to be pushed to back end processing, or perhaps specialized (and perhaps expensive) resources need to be utilized to perform certain operations.   In this talk we'll cover several scenarios where introducing messaging can help, discuss a few messaging patterns, as well as look at abstracting your messaging subsystem to guard against evolving technology and designs.  While examples will be given using Azure Storage Queues and Service Bus Brokered Messaging the concepts can be applied to cloud and on-premises solutions on just about any platform. 
Be a Better Dev	100	As a developer, you end up wearing a lot of different hats: researcher, designer, janitor, mediator, teacher, student… the list can go on.  Likely, you juggle these hats almost every day... and we haven't even mentioned writing a line of code yet. Most talks focus on a given technology or tool: some resource that you can use.  This talks focuses on how to improve the best resource you have: YOU. Come hear how you can improve yourself by learning, teaching - and yes - even being lazy.
Team Foundation Server 2013 Release Management	200	Team Foundation Server 2013 provides a comprehensive ALM solution from portfolio management through development, testing, build automation and now, release management.  This has been a missing piece in Microsoft's ALM solution, but with 2013, you can now configure, approve and deploy your applications for any environment.    In this session, we will walk through how to configure and deploy your application to multiple environments; even to the cloud using Team Foundation Server 2013 Release Management.  We will see how to schedule and trigger a build to kick off a deployment, enable approvers to schedule each promoted release, and to visualize your release pipeline. 
Dev and Test in the Cloud	200	Moving dev and test to the cloud provides a quick and easy way to realize significant benefits of Microsoft Azure.  Organizations naturally prioritize their budget to keep production systems up and running.  This results in development and test being underfunded and not adequately equipped.  It is further complicated by differing infrastructure objectives; dev and test wants to be agile while operations wants to be deliberate.  There can even be challenges between development groups and QA regarding resource allocation.  Microsoft Azure provides a simple solution; move dev and test operations to the cloud and gain agility and budget flexibility while removing resource contention among the different groups in an organization.  This session will explain the benefits of moving dev and test to Azure and will demonstrate a number of ways you can leverage Azure to support your organization's dev and test initiatives. 
Event Source API & Semantic Logging	100	In this discussion we will be focusing on EventSource API in .net framework 4.5 and how Semantic Logging Application Block builds on top of that, providing multiple log destination support using Event Tracing for Windows. We will be discussing how we can bring more structure in our logging using the application block, improving troubleshooting, which can only be achieved by proper and well-designed instrumentation.
Introducing Roslyn	200	Project Roslyn is Microsoft's next-generation compiler for C# and VB that will revolutionize the .NET ecosystem by enabling the average .NET developer to leverage the power of the compiler. In this talk, I will introduce you to the compiler's new API, and demonstrate how exposing the compiler as a service will change the .NET development environment forever.
A Gentle Introduction to CQRS	200	Contemporary software systems are increasingly having to deal with "concurrency" and "scalability". There are various reasons why parallelism is a common contemporary approach but it's complex and there are many patterns & practices that aid with complexity. CQRS builds on those patterns & practices to make concurrency and scalability easier, if you let it. We will discuss the basic principles around CQRS & its roots. We'll discuss where CQRS fits, what types of complexities CQRS will help deal with, & when CQRS might not be a good fit. Some in-the-trenches-type lessons learned and temper the principles with some recommended practices will also be covered. As well, some of the reasons why you'd want to have a CQRS frame-of-mind along with some ways to think CQRS with existing systems without rewriting your whole system. CQRS and its related practices & principles are one of areas of software development that really parallels journeyman/master in the level of detail and skill required for it to be mastered.
How *Not* to Write Concurrent Code	200	Invariants, locking, mutexes, critical sections, monitors, barriers, race conditions, non-deterministic, memory coherence, consistency models, etc. "Multithreading is hard", hard to do correctly and easy to do incorrectly. "Correctly" is almost always application-specific and usually caveated with "it depends". It's hard to define specific rules or practices that work in all circumstances. This session takes a different point of view on things and shows you specific ways to do things "wrong" with regard to multi-thread. This session will detail some of the common primitives and techniques use in multi-threading, but used in the wrong ways. Why they are wrong and alternatives will be covered. Topics like Sleep, DoEvents, volatile, lock, interlocked, thread priority, non-shared data, etc. will be covered.
The Evolution of Asynchronous Programming on .NET	200	Everything you wanted the know about asynchronous programming in .NET, but were afraid to ask. Multithreaded programming is hard. the latest version of Visual Studio includes language additions to C# and VB to make it much easier to write asynchronous code (the async and await keywords). .NET has had numerous ways to implement asynchronous and lengthy operations over the years. This session details some of these techniques, their benefits and their drawbacks. This session also details the progression of these techniques leading up to async/await in an effort to better understand the new syntax as well as better understand how to migrate existing asynchronous code to the new syntax. As well, this session allows you to increase your expertise with several advanced language features that the new syntax and existing patterns build on, like lambdas, anonymous methods, closures, etc.
Bring The Rain: Cloud Powered Continuous Delivery	100	Together we'll harness the power of the cloud and strap a rocket-sled to your build, test, and deployment processes. Using popular open source technologies we'll explore a full end-to-end solution designed to keep you moving quickly and confidently. You'll be automatically building, testing, and shipping your product directly from source control in no time! And, we'll have some fun along the way with helpful metrics, prestigious badges, and have a few laughs with those inevitable (and hopefully infrequent) build failure notifications.
TCP servers done right in .NET	200	Many people say that the arrival of good garbage collected languages mean you don't have to worry about things like memory management any more. This might be the case for line of business software, but what about when you want to write a TCP server capable of dealing with a decent number of connections?  In this talk we'll look at the challenges of TCP servers in C# by converting a synchronous, thread-per-client server to use hipster-compliant asynchronous evented IO and then optimising it not to die from GC pressure.
Build your own SEDA for great win	200	Often developers getting started with using messaging patterns are lured into the murky world of third-party frameworks which do a lot more than they need. In this code-heavy session we'll look at how you can use the generics system in C# to build an in-process Staged Event Driven Architecture to enable an actor-like model.
Responsive Design with Bootstrap 3	100	Bootstrap is a free collection of tools for creating websites and web applications. It contains HTML and CSS-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface components, as well as optional JavaScript and jQuery extensions. See how Bootstrap fits into MVC sites created in Visual Studio 2013 and WebMatrix that deliver a mobile first design approach. CSS development frameworks including LESS and SASS are also demonstrated.
SharePoint 2013 Client Side Rendering	200	Custom SharePoint solutions used to be built with web parts, event receivers, and features. Microsoft says we should use the new App model instead. This talk is about the middle ground of the CSR. Learn how to effectively use JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to render list views, search results, refiners, and more.
Responsive Design in SharePoint 2013	100	Responsive design is used to make web sites form factor friendly. The user interface adjusts automatically whether you browse from a desktop, tablet, smartphone, or other device. Learn what CSS tricks make this work and how they can be applied to SharePoint 2013 internal and external web sites. We will focus on Twitter Bootstrap 2 and 3 and Zork Foundation 4 integration. There are a number of tools on CodePlex to help you accomplish your responsive goals.
Message Based Applications with RabbitMQ / AMQP	200	Building asynchronous messaged based applications scale much better than traditional service oriented architectures.  However, it takes some  adjusting to realize the full potential of how message queues are used to build real-time and dynamic data driven applications.  This session will go over how to architect .Net applications using the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP).  It will cover the basic  concepts and primitives defined by the AMQP standard and RabbitMQ extensions as well as how they translate into some of the traditional  message patterns (Publisher / Subscriber , Observers, Work Queues, etc) 
DataVis with D3	100	In this demo and tutorial based session, learn how to use D3 to develop your own data visualizations.  Some experience with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS is recommended. 
AngularJS Jumpstart	200	Learn the fundamentals about what the AngularJS library can do for you. In this session, you will learn the fundamentals about what the AngularJS library can do for you when building Web applications and how to use some of the key features such as dependency injection, data binding, and navigation. To get the most out of this session, you should have basic knowledge of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.
Build Data-Centric HTML5 Single Page Applications with Breeze	200	Learn how Breeze can help you build rich, data-centric client HTML applications. BreezeJS is a Javascript library that lets you easily retrieve and update data via Web APIs or OData services. In this session you will learn how Breeze can help you with your data-bound HTML UIs to execute rich queries from the client, load and cache the retrieved data, work with it on the client side, validate changes, and save changes back to the server side. You will see how you can integrate Breeze with client separation patterns like MVVM and MVC and integrate with data binding libraries including Knockout and Angular.
Building Rich Data Web APIs with ASP.NET OData	200	ASP.NET Web API makes it really easy to write Web APIs or HTTP services of any flavor. But the vast majority of remote service call needs for client and web applications is to perform CRUD operations - retrieve data, work with it on the client side, and send changes back to the server. The OData protocol standardizes how to do this, and ASP.NET Web API makes it easy and powerful to implement OData services. You’ll see how you can just use one part of OData - the query syntax - to express rich client queries from the client side that get executed server side without needing to use any other part of the OData spec. Or you can go full OData and use the formatting of OData as well as the query syntax and expose CRUD services that will be standardized and interoperable on almost every relevant platform out there today. 
Extending Windows 8, WPF, and Phone apps with XAML Behaviors	200	Behaviors are a way to extend the functionality of the XAML elements you are working with in a clean, reusable way that you can integrate directly into the XAML without violating good separation of concerns principals. Behaviors have been around for a while for WPF and Phone apps, but got a fresh new approach for Store apps in VS 2013 with the Behaviors SDK. In this session you will learn about foundations of behaviors - what they are and how they work. You’ll learn about the built-in behaviors suppled by the Blend team and how to use them for a wide range of common scenarios. And you’ll learn how to write your own custom behaviors for your own specialized scenarios.
Build Maintainable WPF MVVM Apps with Prism 5	300	The Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern has become the standard UI separation pattern in XAML technologies as a way of separating concerns in your client code. In this session you will get a quick review of the fundamentals of MVVM, you'll see how to structure your WPF app with MVVM, and you'll see how to leverage features in Prism such as command, pub/sub events, regions and navigation to build loosely coupled, extensible, and easy to maintain apps. 
Create your own SharePoint 2013 dev. VM. Live!	200	Get ready to create your own SharePoint 2013 dev. VM from scratch using PowerShell scripts. The deep dive session will take you through the hands-on of creating a new dev. VM right from the point where you setup and configure the Windows Server, set up the AD, Install and prepare SQL server 2012 for the SharePoint set up and finally install and configure SharePoint 2013 on it. Upfront software and script download information and steps will be provided so you can follow along and create your own VM along with the speaker if you'd like to.
The New Developer	200	The way we develop applications is changing. The rise of mobile showed that data as a service could empower and reach people like never before.  The trend continued until the point now with smart cars, smart watches, smart consoles and, yes, smart appliances.  Central to this trend is data. And the question developers must answer is "How can I make this data available to the largest group of people possible?"  The answers to this questions vary almost as widely as the data itself, but there are some key tools and techniques developers today are using to make data widely available and enable consumers to get the data in a variety of ways.  Nevertheless, despite the variations there is a common undertone.  In this session we will explore many of the concepts central to this movement such as REST and SPA Frameworks.  We will talk about the difference between an Application and a Service.  And finally, we will discuss the architectural decisions and challenges with exposing your data to the world.
Building a Faceted (read: Awesome) Search Solution using Solr and AngularJs	200	How many times have you had a business user ask for a search engine for your web application?  Then the next thing you hear is “can it have that nice drill down search like Amazon?”.  After removing your forehead from the desk your next step is to try and come up with a SQL or MySQL query to accomplish this.  Oh and don’t forget paging.  Now that query isn’t quite so efficient anymore.  In this session we will look at a really cool approach to this common problem.  Imagine a search engine that was designed and tuned for these types of queries that returns as much metadata (facets) as you like along with pagination counts.  This demo-focused session will explore a solution that uses ASP.NET MVC and SQL for the traditional line-of-business web application and then Solr and AngularJs for the dynamic and lightning-fast search page.
Old and New ideas for improving your application architecture	200	In this talk we will re-visit the common architectural concepts like Serialization and Synchronization to see how we can leverage new ideas/technologies. We will cover Protobuf.NET and Apache Avro, .NET Immutable collections and a little bit of Reactive Programming. Yes, the topics are across the spectrum, and hopefully make the session an interesting one for you!
Introduction to Functional Data Structures in F#	100	Arrays are the fundamental data structure for procedural programming language. While arrays can be used effectively in F#, purely functional programs demand purely functional data structures. We will review the fundamental functional data structures, the list and the tree, and then see how to extend them to solve specific problems in functional code.
Integrating .NET Code into Microsoft Excel using ExcelDNA	100	In the past ,creating XLL extensions for Microsoft Excel has been rewarding, but often too time-consuming to be worthwhile. However, now that multicore processors are the rule there seems to be more reason than ever to go beyond the single-thread limitations of VBA code and COM libraries. We will see how to use the open-source ExcelDNA project to load managed code created with C# or F# into Excel as an XLL,  and integrate new functionality into Excel workbooks.
Modern Web Development Workflow backed by .NET	200	The client-side toolset is moving faster than the Visual Studio release cycle. While Visual Studio remains king of .NET development, modern web interfaces have shifted away from server-generated HTML and into JavaScript libraries like Angular or Ember. This talk focuses on breaking your web UI out of Visual Studio and making it an isolated, testable, first-class citizen like you would do for your Android or iOS applications. Learn how to create powerful, rich web interfaces using the right tools for the job while retaining server-side logic in the languages you know.
Dethroning Grunt: Simple and Effective Builds with Gulp	100	Grunt is king. It is the ubiquitous task runner used for most nodejs projects and has quickly expanded to conquer other software ecosystems. However, its kingdom is vulnerable. Grunt does not align well with many nodejs paradigms and is notorious for its harsh learning curve. Meet Gulp, the challenger in the taskrunner revolution. Gulp’s easy configuration produces an easy learning curve, and its alignment with nodejs paradigms eliminates the friction. Grab your ticket, your foam finger, and your team-colored face paint and witness the battle, the revolution, and the crowning of Gulp.
What does it mean to be Agile?	100	You have  heard it before: " We're agile." Or, we practice agile methodologies. etc, etc.   It may surprise you to know there is no such thing as an "Agile Process". There are Agile Principles that are codified in the Agile Manifesto and a process, whatever it is, may be compliant with those principles. A good example is Scrum - which is a framework for solving complex business problems. Another popular methodology is XP (Extreme Programming). There's also LEAN. All of these are implementations, to one extent or another, of agile principles. In this session, John will facilitate a discussion around the the fundamentals of agile. What does the manifesto actually say? What doesn't it say? After this session, you'll be equipped with the basics of evaluating your agile efforts within your organization. 
Writing a compiler using C#, Irony, and RunSharp	300	(I listed this as a 300 level, but I'll try to tone it down to a 200)  In this talk, I'll introduce a rather exotic programming language (Shakespeare), and then lead the audience thru the grammar, building a parser, writing a support library, creating three different code generators (C source code, C# source code, and MSIL),  and building a command-line tool to tie all the parts together. 
PowerShell for Developers	200	Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP) Doug Finke takes us through PowerShell from a developer’s point of view. Doug shows techniques for integrating/debugging PowerShell from and to C# code as well as using PowerShell with a Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) application. He also addresses using reflection at the command line, object pipelining, and PowerShell’s REPL. 
PowerShell in a DevOps environment	200	In this session Doug Finke walks through Windows PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC), a new management system in Windows PowerShell that enables the deployment and management of configuration data for software services and the environment on which these services run.  Doug demos how to stand up and configure your components in a repeatable, reliable way, taking agility to the next level. Plus, he shows how this enables the DevOps discussion in your organization.
Achieve 100% Code Re-Use with Xamarin Forms + Azure Mobile Services	200	With the introduction of Xamarin Forms, developers are able to reach Android, iOS, and Windows from a 100% shared codebase.  Using Azure Mobile Services with Xamarin forms enables rapid development of cross-platform apps that securely store data in the cloud. In this session we will discuss how the pieces fit together and create a small app demonstrating the end-to-end flow of data across multiple devices on different platforms.

Reactive Extensions (Rx) with the ReactiveUI (RxUI) library makes it easy to write declarative event-driven programs. This session will show how to use these libraries to create a XAML-based UI that works across iOS, Android and Windows Phone.
Scaling Teams - The Human Side of Service Oriented Architecture	300	A lot has been said and written about the performance and scaling benefits of service-oriented architectures. So much, that I now see early startups beginning with an SOA in an effort to build something scalable the first time, so that they only have to build something once if they ever grow past the limitations of their monolithic architectures.  Having spent the past year at Groupon leading a team that helped move various parts of our architecture into globally scalable services, I want to make the case for smaller startups to stick with a monolithic architecture, and present the case that scaling an application is as much about scaling teams as it is about scaling performance and capacity.  The talk will cover technical details of service-oriented architecture in general, and Groupon's in particular, but will also cover non-technical topics such as project management, communication, team building, and employee satisfaction as they relate to building an SOA.

Thorsten Hans will give you an introduction into both, the new Office 365 API and the Office 365 API Tools for Visual Studio. During this talk you'll learn how to integrate data from Office 365 into Web Applications and how to implement AuthN for single Office 365 tenants or for multiple tenants which offers great possibilities for ISVs.
Speed up SharePoint App Development using ShareCoffee	200	ShareCoffee is a community driven OpenSource library which provides an single, unified API for JavaScript across all SharePoint REST API's. No matter if you're building SharePoint Apps which are running Provider- or SharePoint-Hosted, not matter if you're accessing data from App- or from the HostWeb. ShareCoffee gives you an unified API to call them all in the same fashion. ShareCoffee also provides great API's to get common App-Developer tasks done easily such as loading Chrome Controls or retrieving a preconfigured CSOM ClientContext for doing CrossDomain calls. Join and learn how to increase your productivity!   
AngularJS <3 ASP.NET MVC	200	Many Frameworks has been hyped during the last decade, but AngularJS is perhaps the most popular one ever. This small Open Source Framework offers a great environment to rapidly build structured Web Applications on the client-side using only plain language features from HTML and JavaScript. Both the great flexibility and the performance from AngularJS allows you as a developer to build rock-solid applications on top of this framework. Thorsten Hans will give an introduction into AngularJS and demonstrate you how to combine both AngularJS and latest ASP.NET MVC in order to build scalable Web Applications.
A Whirlwind Tour of Xamarin	100	Xamarin allows C# developers to target multiple platforms with the language and tools they love. Whether you’re looking to build cross-platform mobile applications targeting iOS and Android or if you are hoping to build the next great Mac application, Xamain has you covered. In this session, I’ll briefly cover where Xamarin came from (believe it or not it has been around since 2009!) and where it’s heading before launching into a tour of its features and workflows. I’ll show you how to use Xamarin Studio and Visual Studio to build iOS and Android applications. You’ll leave with enough knowledge to decide for yourself (or convince your boss!) that Xamarin is right for your project.
Creating Xamarin Bindings for Native iOS Libraries	300	So, you found a really awesome component for iOS but there's no Xamarin support.  Guess you're out of luck, huh? Thankfully, it is your lucky day! In this session I will show you what steps you need to take to create C# bindings to native iOS libraries so that you can bring all the fun things you find on Cocoa Controls into your Xamarin applications. I will cover binding simple libraries using Objective Sharpie as well as more advanced manual examples using iOS Binding Projects. Finally, I'll cover the steps necessary to create a component out of your newly bound project for submission to the Xamarin Component Store.
Creating Cross-Platform Mobile Apps Using C# with Xamarin	200	iOS and Android present great opportunities for developers.  Unfortunately, many developers shy away because of the unfamiliar development environment. It doesn't have to be that way! Come learn how to build Android and iOS applications using C# with Xamarin 3.0. You'll learn how to use your existing C# skills to build apps for these platforms (and Windows Phone+Windows 8!) from within the same solution in Visual Studio! You'll also see how Xamarin.Forms allows you to achieve up to 100% code sharing between iOS, Android, and Windows Phone while still preserving native performance and look & feel.
Build Real-Time Websites and Apps with SignalR	200	If you've ever wanted to build a highly responsive app that leverages a real-time communications library, then SignalR is for you! Real-time web functionality is the ability to have the server push messaging aggressively to the client, rather than relying on the client to make multiple and frequent requests. SignalR is a set of ASP.NET server and client libraries that you can use to build real time, scalable, websites and apps. You can use SignalR in both enterprise and consumer apps, and across platforms. This session covers what you need to know to build a SignalR app that connects multiple clients instantaneously. 
I just met you, and "this" is crazy, but here's my NaN, so call(me) maybe? 	200	JavaScript can be a passive-aggressive and fickle language that frustrates you at every turn! It lets you do things like declare variables wherever you want but doesn’t tell you that it will hoist them while you’re not looking. JavaScript’s this keyword is anything but, and eval can turn good code to evil fast. In this session, we will discuss the top 10 common JavaScript headaches, mistakes, or quirks you just need to know as well as how you can avoid them. Learn what can trip you, like the this keyword, JavaScript scoping, evil Eval, and the use of the With statement (VB devs beware!). Alongside those gotchas is the fact that not all equality operators are created equal and how the innocent looking parseInt() causes farce parses, and this session will dig into all these language quirks and more!
Write Next Generation Object Oriented JavaScript with TypeScript	200	TypeScript is Javascript evolved, so if you’re writing in Javascript, TypeScript is worth checking out. Come to this session and learn all about the TypeScript language from its object oriented features to its ES6-style capabilities.

Web Runtime Architecture & Performance Deep Dive	300	When does a browser render CSS, HTML, or JavaScript and in what order? How can you cut down on bandwidth and size? What's happening behind the scenes between the DOM and the browser? If you want answers to these questions and other like them, come to this session. We're going to do deep dive tour of how browsers, and IE in particular, fetch, assemble, and render content, as well as what goes on under the hood and when. You'll learn about how IE's Trident layout engine renders HTML and CSS, and how its Chakra engine loads and runs JavaScript. It's all part of IE's runtime architecture, and knowing how this architecture works enables you to build best performing web pages and HTML5 apps. In addition, we'll look at new developer tools that detect runtime performance patterns, that you can use in building better performing user experiences.
Elasticsearch.NET and NEST 1.0	100	Elasticsearch.NET and NEST are both the official low-level and high-level .NET clients of Elasticsearch.

This session will kick off with an Elasticsearch primer covering installation and configuration on Windows, followed by a brief overview of indexing and querying via Elaticsearch's REST API.  We will then dive into a detailed overview of the NEST and Elasticsearch.NET libraries, covering the new features introduced in 1.0, complete with coding examples and a sample MVC app demoing the full-text search capabilities of Elasticsearch.
Xamarin and MVVMCross: MVVM to share your code	200	Developing applications using Xamarin enables you to write your service layer one time and share that code among all of that platforms. But, this still does not alleviate the problem of coding the view level details and connecting them to this shared service layer. Enter MVVMCross, developed by Stuart Lodge. MVVMCross embraces the shared nature permitted by Xamarin and allow you to share view model to all projects from a Core project. This enables developers to share code at an even deeper level than permitted by Xamarin alone and enables MVVM to be the guiding force in application feature development. In this talk I will discuss where MVVMCross comes from, how it is installed and why it is important. We will cover examples ranging from basic setup, to integration with Xamarin components, to how MVVM can be applied across platforms. My goal is to show developers just how much more of their code can be shared between platforms which makes development that much easier and rewarding
Top 10 Ways to Go from Good to Great Scrum Master	200	The Scrum Master role in an organization can be difficult.  You live between a rock and a hard place.  You're influential but you probably don't have any real power.  You're not a project manager but you're on the hook for delivering.  You're asked to promise dates when the best you can give is a forecast.  You're long on responsibility and short on power.  (Awesome.) But you do it because it's a great job, right?  There's nothing like helping your team come together and deliver actual working software.    It takes a special kind of person to be Scrum Master -- Nerves of steel, a lot of finesse, and some ridiculously great people skills.  It's a lot of knowing what to look for and knowing how to fix it.  Even better if you can anticipate issues and get in front of them.  What can you do to help keep everything on track?  How do you have the difficult conversations when things are 'sub-optimal'?  From that lazy guy on your team, to the Product Owner who doesn't like to estimate, to you losing your mind because you're always picking up the slack.  How do you help your team to solve problems and really sing?  You're a good Scrum Master.  Come find out how to be great.   
Scrum Under a Waterfall	200	It would be so easy if everyone at our companies just used Scrum -- or at least Agile.  No one would lean on the team for dates and deadlines, and everyone would know that change is a good thing.  It'd be one great big happy project management family.  But let's face it -- an all-Agile organization isn't always possible.  Maybe you have a Project Management Office (PMO).  Maybe you work for a government contractor.  Maybe you have regulatory requirements.  Maybe you're the first Scrum/Agile project at your company.  Maybe your company simply *likes* it this way.  Whatever the reason, Agile teams frequently report into Waterfall organizations.   Your team thinks "backlog" and your bosses think "project plan."  How do you make it work?  How do you ensure communication and foster trust between the two groups?  How do you bridge the project management impedance mismatch?  You need to find a way get everybody to ‘play nice’ so they can do their jobs. In this session, we’ll drill into the details of the project management impedance mismatch and talk about strategies to improve communication and delivery when you need to make Agile work inside a Waterfall-centric organization.     
Zero to Hero: Untested to Tested with Microsoft Fakes	300	You've got an application with no tests. Trust me. You're not alone. You'd love to get some great code coverage but no one ever thought about tests while they were building the app. It's tightly-coupled and there just isn't a good place to start adding unit tests. It feels hopeless but Visual Studio is here to help with Microsoft Fakes Framework. In this session we show you how to take a tightly-coupled app and turn it into something a lot more testable. Along the way, we also talk about the design patterns that will help you refactor your code for testability and make *future* code more testable from the start. When we're done, we'll not only have a well-tested app but we'll have a better software architecture with a clean separation of concerns that's much more maintainable. 
Have you finished testing?  Are you ready to ship?	300	In this session we cover how you can perform lightweight testing using the web-based test case management capabilities of Team Foundation Server or Visual Studio Online. We cover recent improvements to test case management starting with test organization, simplified test case authoring, managing test data at one central location, exporting test artifacts for review/sign-offs, lightweight test execution with bug filing, and so on. We show how you can improve your application quality and engage end-users across the enterprise using our tools. We also cover how Microsoft Test Manager helps you with a holistic quality enablement using exploratory testing, capturing rich diagnostic data during testing, and running automated tests across different environments. 
Visual Studio the only tool for the database developer?	100	Okay Visual Studio may not be the only tool for the database developer, however there is a lot you can do without going to SQL Server Management Studio.

Creating custom Word and Excel Documents using Open XML Format	100	The 2007 Microsoft® Office system introduces a new file format that is based on XML called Open XML Formats. Microsoft Office Word 2007, Microsoft Office Excel® 2007, and Microsoft Office PowerPoint® 2007 all use these formats as the default file format.  Shortly after the release of VS2010 Microsoft did an out of band release of the Open XML Format SDK. This session will show how to use this SDK to create and manipulate Word and Excel documents. 
The Practical Side of Bitcoin 	100	It’s in the news all the time, and you just don’t know what to think about it. But, Bitcoin is here to stay.  It has even been sold by the FBI from confiscated goods.  Yes, it’s a “commodity”  but we are using it to barter for plane tickets, TV’s, laptops and cell phones. This talk will discuss how to obtain Bitcoins, how they can be used as a payment system, and how to use it day to day.    This is an introduction to Bitcoin for those that have no background in digital currency.  The discussion will show how easy it is to send and receive bit coins, as well as how it stands up to traditional payment processes. Leave this discussion with a digital wallet on your phone!

Top 5 Mistakes Enterprise Developers Make When Going Mobile	100	Every developer must go mobile!  By 2015, tablets will be outselling desktops and portable PCs combined (IDC, May 2013).  With mobile’s unparalleled growth rate and unmatched subscriber counts, there’s no doubt that nearly every developer is either already going mobile, or thinking about it. Even tried and true mission critical desktop apps and large-scale enterprise systems have companion mobile apps that let users interact with desktop files or large systems while on the go. You too can create an awesome mobile user experience for your app and we've prepared and will discuss this list of 5 common mistakes that developers make when taking Enterprise functionality mobile - and how you can avoid them:  1. Trying to fit a desktop experience onto a mobile device 2. Not making the mobile user experience your top priority 3. Too much gets between your app, the OS and the Hardware 4. Building separate apps for different platforms 5. Not doubling down on security
“Rethink Your Infrastructure to Rebuild Your Code”	100	Developers love to ship changes: improving existing features and building new features to improve customer satisfaction is, after all, at the core of what they do. Software quality, code reviews and proper testing are cornerstones of shipping constantly, but developers need to be mindful of not interrupting service in the process.   Today, shipping less is simply not an option. Developers need everyone on their team to focus on how to improve the product. This session will encourage attendees to rethink the way they have built infrastructure and introduce a new form of workflow that implements practices like testing, virtualized environments and immutable infrastructure.   Flo will offer helpful tips, such as: ·       Thinking of servers like Post Its (useful, easy to understand and replaced without thinking twice) ·       Using different tools to ship regularly and build infrastructure that supports and innovates for thousands of developers ·       Ensuring there is a proper workflow in place that supports, and does not hinder, team activity   Attendees of all experience levels will walk away with an understanding of the importance of focusing only on the changes they introduce into their code and leaving everything else to automation.
AngularJS for ASP.NET MVC Developers	200	Angular continues to take the market on a wild ride. Its courses are popular and its developer base growing daily. Google wrote Angular to have no external dependencies and in fact many devs use it with HTML alone. But we’re Microsoft devs and we know that ASP.NET MVC is the best delivery platform for HTML out there. So why not make it an equally awesome delivery platform for Angular-based apps as well? When using ASP.NET MVC, you need to to know how to set Angular up with regards to modules, controllers, and services. And the truth is that not the entire site needs to be one giant Single-Page-Application. I’ll show how to design an ASP.NET MVC site so that it includes pockets of SPA that use Angular, taking advantage of binding, routing, and even back-button support - all while remaining on the client.
Deep Dive into Dependency Injection & Writing Testable Software	200	OK so you think you have a decent understanding of what Dependency Injection is right? But the truth is that to really write testable software you need to stop any hard class instantiation anywhere in your applications. We’re talking about a full embracement and understanding of dealing with abstractions and lifetime management. There are also details you need to understand about how DI Containers work and what makes one differ from the other. In this session, I’ll jump right into DI usage on various platforms. I’ll show you how to use it in a web, desktop, and even back-end service and data-access environment. I’ll also bring other patterns, like Abstract Factory, into play to solve other types of problem in conjunction with Dependency Injection. In the end, a combination of technique and product will ensure that your applications remain testable and extensible every step of the way. 
User Story Mapping	200	Initially put forward by Jeff Patton, Use Story Mapping is an approach to Organizing and Prioritizing User Stories.  In this hands on exercise, we will jointly create a user map, clearly defining order, minimal marketable features, and release plans.  Hat tip to Steven Rogalsky for first showing me this workshop.
Effective Leadership	200	Leaders aren't born, they aren't hatched, and they don't apparate. Leadership is a journey, one that involves hard work, practice, and a deep understanding of not only your team members but also yourself. I've led teams large and small throughout my 30 year career, and certainly made plenty of mistakes on the way,  But I've learned to fail fast, iterate, and continuously improve to create high performing teams across multiple verticals. 
Being Remote Doesn't Have to be Hard	200	More and more employees are looking to be remote, at least part time.  And an increasing number of companies are allowing remote workers.  What does it mean to be a remote worker or manage remote workers?  As a long time remote worker and manager of a remote work force, I will lead an interactive discussion on the ups and downs of being remote.
Event sourcing applied - building CQRS application with the event store and .NET	200	Almost every non-trivial software system requires some sort of a persistence. Relational databases and for some time already more and more no-sql databases are being used to persist the state of the system. In the event sourcing approach all relevant events that happened in the system are being stored which in adds the time dimension to the picture. In addition to the benefit of having recorded history of the system, event sourced systems combined with CQRS architecture are much easier to scale horizontally. This session is a short introduction to CQRS and event sourcing with working example of .NET application built with event sourcing and CQRS architecture. Basic concepts such an domain event, aggregate, projection and an event store will be introduced and demonstrated. 
Bootstrap your web styles with Twitter Bootstrap and LESS	100	Twitter Bootstrap is a simple but powerful CSS framework that simplifies web and front-end development.

Gaining the Knowledge of the Open Data Protocol (OData)	100	The Open Data Protocol (OData) is an open protocol for sharing data. It provides a way to break down data silos and increase the shared value of data by creating an ecosystem in which data consumers can interoperate with data producers in a way that is far more powerful than currently possible, enabling more applications to make sense of a broader set of data. Every producer and consumer of data that participates in this ecosystem increases its overall value.  OData is consistent with the way the Web works – it makes a deep commitment to URIs for resource identification and commits to an HTTP-based, uniform interface for interacting with those resources (just like the Web).   This commitment to core Web principles allows OData to enable a new level of data integration and interoperability across a broad range of clients, servers, services, and tools.  In this talk Chris Woodruff will provide an in depth knowledge to this protocol and how to implement an OData service on Windows using the WCF Data Services and ASP.NET WebAPI products.

We will be discussing how we can bring more structure in our logging using the application block, improving troubleshooting of problems. This can only be achieved by proper and well-designed instrumentation.
Absolute beginner's session on WCF	100	Are you brand new to WCF (Windows Communication Foundation) and would like to see some beginner/introduction demos on WCF?  If so, this session is for you?   In this session I'll cover the basics of WCF, and show a variety of small but meaningful demos to focus on how you can incorporate WCF into applications.  I've used WCF in production applications and can walk you through some of the learning curve in this session.
T-SQL for Application Developeors - attendees choose topics	200	That's right, attendees choose! I'll show nearly 30 possible topics on the screen, and the attendees vote at the beginning on which topics I'll cover.   Everything from isolation levels to ranking...everything from GUIDs to table-valued functions....everything from querying temporal data to instances where subqueries are necessary....everything from update triggers to reading execution plans...everything from cumulative totals to uses for UNPIVOT....and more!  You'll walk away with 30 code samples, even though we'll only cover a portion of them in the presentation. This has always been a very popular session. 
Aggregate your Data with MongoDB	200	The MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline is a ridiculously powerful tool for querying and aggregating your data. In this session, I will walk you through how to stage your queries through each step of the pipeline. I will show you how to use $project, $match, $group, and the rest of the option to their full ability.
Managing Developers	200	Most modern day workers have a very negative view on middle or front line managers. They see managers as waste and a constant source of interruptions to their day. My contention is exactly the opposite. A “Good” manager should make their developers more productive. Not by standing over their shoulder and making sure they are working, but by standing behind them and keeping everyone else off their backs.  In this session I will teach you the top attributes of a really good manager and how to implement them for your team. I will show you how to improve the productivity and satisfaction of your team members with 10 straightforward techniques.
Rocking Out With Android Studio	100	Android Development has come a long way with the release of Android Studio. In this sessions we will explore the power of Google’s new development platform – along with some tips and tricks for how to get the most out of it. 
The Right Amount Of Planning	100	With agile projects, finding the balance of planning can be a difficult balance. Plan too much, and when things change (and they will) your time was wasted. However, if you plan too little, you may end up going off in the wrong direction. In this session, we will discuss what the right amount of planning is to get you started, but how to avoid doing so much that you are wasting your time. 
CSS is Easy! No, Really...	100	If you laughed out loud at the session title than you are where I was no long ago. To put it bluntly CSS sucks... That is until Bootstrap came along and removed all the pain and suffering that came along with CSS. It this session I will walk you through Bootstrap and show you all the powerful features it has to offer. 
Build a Restful API with Node.js and Express	200	Node.js is a simple and powerful tool for backend development. And to make it even better, it is written in JavaScript, everyone's favorite language.

Let’s keep this simple: Cross-platform Hybrid Mobile development | One codebase | Telerik Platform| AppBuilder | HTML5/JS | Cordova | IDEs | Backend Services | Prototype/Test/Deploy/Manage | End-to-End Mobile.  Join me as we explore the possibilities! 
Take control of your interface - Crafting API responses for your clients	200	Web frameworks help you build an API quickly but most have little support for dealing with an API that needs to evolve, forcing you to prematurely version your API.  Take back control of the content you send over the wire.  API responses are the "user interface" of your API and should be crafted with same attention to detail that cause designers to fret over color choices, shadows and highlights.  In this talk I’ll show you what I have learned about API response design in the last 8 years of building Web APIs. I'll cover issues like structuring for evolution, sizing for optimum caching, the different ways to include metadata, media type selection and many other issues that surface when trying to design an API for the long haul.
Hypermedia APIs can be game changing, but the secret sauce is in the client.	200	Have you built a hypermedia API, or thinking about it and still puzzled as to what all the hype is about?  You see some incremental benefits, some extra work, but nothing game changing.  People like to throw around the HATEOAS acronym and talk about state machines defining your application.  But what does that actually mean.  How does that help?  The difference lies in writing a client that is driven by the hypermedia API rather than simply using the hypermedia API.  This talk will show code examples that demonstrate how to build mobile and desktop client applications that are simpler, easier to support on multiple platforms, more maintainable and require updating less often. 
How to Write Browser-Based Tests That AREN'T a Waste of Time 	100	Imagine this: you've written a whole suite of tests that open up a browser and run through your entire web application, entering text and clicking on buttons just like a real user would. Even though they may take a while to write and to run, you're confident that your browser-based test suite does a pretty good job of verifying the whole system. Quality is great and users are happy!      Then you need to make some UI change which breaks a dozen tests and you just don't have time to fix them all... so you ignore them and promise yourself you'll go back and fix them when you have the time (which you never do).    Then it happens AGAIN, resulting in a dozen more ignored tests.    THEN...  Well, you get the point.    Not too long ago, experiences like that caused me to completely write off browser-based automated tests as flaky and a huge waste of time.  That is, until I realized the main reason that my tests were so flaky is that I was writing them all wrong!  In this presentation we'll look at a subtle but powerful approach to browser-based testing that abstracts your test code from the details of your UI, making your tests easier to maintain by keeping you from having to rewrite them all the time, and bringing back the value of having browser-based automated tests again! 
Automated Unit Testing for Mere Mortals 	100	Are you intrigued by the great potential benefits of automated unit testing, but get turned off by all of the jargon like TDD, BDD, etc. as well as a whole new suite of tools to download, learn, and sell to your team? You may be surprised to know just easy and accessible automated unit testing can be… using the Visual Studio tools you most likely already have installed!    In this talk we will discuss what, exactly, "automated unit testing" means, then dispel many of the popular unit testing myths and misconceptions. We'll even look at various ways to add automated unit tests to your existing applications. With any luck, you'll be able to walk out of this talk ready to leverage automated unit tests in your current project starting immediately. 
Intro to AngularJS:  Hello, client-side MVC!	100	AngularJS - you've seen it everywhere, but just what the heck is it?  What's so great about it?  Why would you choose to learn a whole new application framework when you already know and love jQuery (and/or KnockoutJS)?  In this discussion I'll walk you through the basics of AngularJS, from the very first lines of code you may write to those annoying gotchas that annoy everyone who starts out with the framework.  I'll show you how AngularJS can fundamentally change the way that you think about writing your rich client-side web applications.
Application Performance & The .NET/ASP.NET Developer	200	This action packed session discusses application performance from the eyes of the developer. Looking into tips, tricks, and tools to help developers keep their applications under control in various situations. This joint session for ASP.NET and Non-ASP.NET developers will help to illustrate the differences that application type, user type, and deployment scenarios can have on the performance needs and issues surrounding an application. Third-party tools will be discussed in this session as a method of helping to diagnose and resolve issues.
A Practical Implementation of Async	200	Rather than coming up with a focused "Example" of Async that attendees will have to go back an work on their own to understand how to integrate the technology with their application. This session uses multiple real-world applications to show practical implementations of Async within actual applications. These samples are coupled with detailed background information on WHY the technology was used. By using this approach we are able to cover various scenarios and implementations of the Async pattern, including offloading, parallelism, and behind the scenes optimizations. All sample applications will be available for attendees as well after the session to ensure that understanding can continue from the session.
ASP.NET 4.5 For Web Forms Developers 	200	There are a lot of us out there for a number of reasons that might not be working with ASP.NET MVC and might not have a plan to migrate to it anytime soon. With .NET 4.5 Microsoft proves that it isn't a big deal and added a bunch of much needed enhancements to the ASP.NET 4.5 Web Forms framework that brings some of the nicest features that were introduced in MVC to those of us using Web Forms.  In this practical demo we will investigate these new features and discuss how they can be used to help improve developer productivity!

Scrum or Kanban, Whats the Difference?	200	Most of us are familiar with Scrum already. Some of you may be aware of the new trend to adopt Lean techniques, specifically Kanban. Often Kanban is presented as an alternative to Scrum. In this session we’ll take a look at what this Kanban thing is all about; specifically comparing it to Scrum. How is it different than Scrum? What does it do better or worse? When should you consider Kanban or Scrum for your team? Even when and why you may want to use them both at the same time.
Intro to CQRS and Event Sourcing Distributed Architecture Patterns	300	CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) and Event Sourcing are two distributed architecture patterns that when combined produce a very compelling architecture for a lot of problems that we as software developers face on a regular basis. Why do we insist on using the same data model to service both the transactional portion of our software and the queries/read portion? We typically only store the current state of our entities, what happens when the business wants to do some analysis on *why* the data is what it is?  The CQRS + Event Sourcing patterns attempt to address these concerns and provide a number of other valuable benefits, both technical benefits, but more importantly business benefits that translate directly into business value for your organization.
Evolve Your Code: Fundamental Design Principles	300	If I could travel back in time and give the rookie developer version of myself an hour of advice, this session will be that advice. I'm specifically focusing on advice that will help us write better code. I've written a lot of horrible code in my career, and learned a lot of lessons in the process. In my day job I also get the opportunity to look at a lot of other teams code, and help them clean it up. Over my career I've gotten a pretty good idea of what I believe are the most important lessons when learning to write "good" code. And here's a hint, it's not neatly captured in the SOLID set of principles that seem to be so popular at conferences these days.  Expect a lot of examples and concrete advice that you can take away and start applying immediately to improve your code.
CodedUI: The Good Parts	300	After years of working with development teams trying to leverage CodedUI for UI Automation testing, we’ve learned a lot about what works and what doesn’t.  In this session I’ll share some of the learnings about how to use CodedUI most effectively to create UI Automation Test Suites for your large enterprise applications.  The typical approach with CodedUI using UIMaps – while it looks great in demo’s – has challenges scaling to real-world large enterprise applications.  I’ll share with you how I use CodedUI in a code-first approach - with no UI Maps – to create effective, and most importantly maintainable test frameworks for large applications.  In addition we’ll look at how CodedUI Tests integrate into the MS ALM tooling, including remote execution from Microsoft Test Manager, and integration with TFS Builds.
Delivering High Quality Code Using Visual Studio	300	Teams delivering high-quality software tend to have some common practices and tools that they use. In this session I’ll share what I’ve learned working with many mature teams that deliver high-quality software, and also time spent working with problematic code-bases trying to improve the quality in an incremental fashion.  There are many tools available in Visual Studio, and some 3rd party tools that can help development teams in this area.  Some of these you’ll probably be familiar with, and some of these may be new to you.  Tools such as Static Analysis tools, Architectural Validation Tools (e.g. Layer Diagrams), Code Clone Analysis, etc.  In this session I’ll take you on a tour of the tools I use most often, and give some lessons learned and tips and tricks about how to apply them most effectively to improve your code-base.
Beyond Cortana & Siri: Using Speech Recognition & Synthesis for the Next Generation of Mobile Apps	300	Our society has a problem. Individuals are hooked on apps, phones, tablets and social networking. We created these devices and these apps that have become a core part of our lives but we stopped short. We failed to recognize some of the problematic situations where our apps are used. People are texting, emailing and chatting while driving. Pedestrians walk into busy intersections and into sidewalk hazards because they refuse to put their phone down. We cannot entirely blame them. We created a mobile revolution, and now we just can’t simply ask them to put it on hold when it’s not convenient. It’s almost an addiction and too often it has led to fatal results.  Furthermore, mobile applications are not always easy to work with due to the small screen and on-screen keyboard. Other people struggle to use traditional computing devices due to handicaps. Using our voice is a natural form of communication amongst humans. Ever since 2001: A Space Odyssey, we’ve been dreaming of computers who can converse with us like HAL9000 or the Star Trek computers. Or maybe you’re part of the new generation of geeks dreaming of Halo’s Cortana? Thanks to the new advances and SDKs for speech recognition and synthesis (aka text-to-speech), we are now several steps closer to this reality. Siri is not the end game, she’s the beginning. This session explores the design models and development techniques you can use to add voice recognition to your mobile applications, including in-app commands, standard & custom grammars, and voice commands usable outside your app. We’ll also see how your apps can respond to the user via speech synthesis, opening-up a new world of hands-free scenarios. This reality is here, you’ll see actual live cross-platform demos with speech and you can now learn how to do it. Speech support is not just cool or a convenience, it should be a necessity in many apps.

We’ll then explore the converged WinRT API services and features, such as touch input, accelerometers, Live Tiles, etc. We’ll also spend valuable time going over the new app model for Windows device apps, how to share code between phone and tablet, and how to build a converged UI in XAML for Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone. Lastly we’ll go over the app packaging and how to submit your Universal apps to the Windows Store. The converged Windows Platform is more efficient and far-reaching than ever. Come learn how to build mobile apps for hundreds of millions of Windows device users.
Build Your First Mobile App in 1 hour with Microsoft App Studio	200	Microsoft App Studio is an innovative new tool to design and build a starter app for Windows Phone and Windows Store without writing any code. Whether you’re a mobile development neophyte or a savvy developer filled with great ideas but not enough time to prototype them, App Studio can help you get started by building the core of your application using multiple page templates and data sources, such as RSS feeds, YouTube videos, Flickr photos, HTML content, custom collections and more. In this session, we’ll build a live & working mobile app for both Windows Phone and Windows Store on the fly, exploring the various options of App Studio. We’ll then generate the source code and dive into Visual Studio to understand the various parts produced by App Studio and how to extend them. We’ll discuss how to add custom features to the starter app, turning our prototype into a real-world app, such as advertising, in-app purchasing and such. Lastly we’ll go over what’s involved to get the app published, how the submission process works, and where to take your app from there. If you still haven’t published any mobile apps, it doesn’t get any easier than with App Studio. Come learn how to get from “Idea” to “Publish” in just a few hours.
From Prototype to the Store – Publishing Real-World Mobile Apps	200	Windows Phone development is highly productive, relatively easy and fun. If you’re already a .NET developer, you can get up and running with the Windows Phone SDK pretty fast. The same goes for Windows. Android is a different animal but still approachable. iOS has a steeper learning curve for the .NET folks, but many devs started their mobile development there. Maybe you’ve already even built a prototype or two. Stuff runs. You deploy it to your phone. Ready to publish, right? Wrong. There’s a difference between a functional prototype and a final store-ready app. This session explores recommendations and best practices to turn your fledgling app into a real professional submission. We’ll look at the user experience, the “About” page, tracking the update history, getting feedback from users, driving reviews, providing help, iconography, sharing your app and more. We’ll also go over monetization strategies and how to rely on in-app purchases & advertising, trials and paid/free apps. With hundreds of thousands of apps to compete with, you need to go above and beyond to impress your users. Come learn how to do it for a maximum impact in a session packed with tips, tricks, do’s and don’ts. While many of the demos in this session apply for Windows Phone and Windows, this session also includes content for iOS and Android developers.
Building Windows Phone Apps with Maps, Location Services & Geofencing	300	This session will not teach you why we are on Earth, but it will teach you how to find out where we are on it. Looking for the user? Find the phone. Thanks to standard built-in Location Services and hybrid positioning hardware, every Windows Phone knows where it is. In this session, ActiveNick shows you how to build a truly “smart” phone application by adding Location Intelligence Services (LIS) to it. Using Microsoft Visual Studio, the Windows Phones SDK and other geospatial APIs from Nokia and Bing Maps, you will learn how to locate the device in the world using the phone GPS and other Location Services, display maps and manipulate them with touch gestures, geocode addresses into lat/long pairs, and display the results on a map using pushpins, UI elements and more. We’ll also discuss geofencing and location-based triggers, as well as background location tracking apps. We’ll discuss the various mapping technologies, SDKs and APIs in the GIS world and explore how Windows Phone apps can participate in geospatial circles. Location Intelligence is a natural extension of mobility: Come learn how it’s done.
Building Multi-Platform Mobile Apps with Push Notifications & Cloud Services	300	The best mobile applications don’t live in a vacuum. They are augmented by dedicated servers, the Internet and Cloud services. While it’s one thing to reach out to server-side services from a mobile application, it’s a completely different affair when the tables are turned and the server needs to reach the phone. Enter push notifications. From iOS to Android, Windows Phone and Windows 8, discover how to send push notifications from cloud-hosted services to a mobile app running on a tablet or phone, and learn how to handle those alerts in your mobile app. We’ll discuss the various push notification services from Microsoft, Apple and Google, how to leverage them in your mobile applications, how to deal with push scenarios for any given multi-platform app, and we’ll also look at Notification Hubs that can let you push millions of notifications with just a few lines of code. The live demos showcase a real-world app designed for Windows Phone, Windows, iOS and Android.
When to NoSQL and when to Know SQL	100	With NoSQL, NewSQL and plain old SQL, there are so many tools around it’s not always clear which is the right one for the job.  This is a look at a series of NoSQL technologies, comparing them against traditional SQL technology. I’ll compare real use cases and show how they are solved with both NoSQL options, and traditional SQL servers, and then see who wins.   We’ll look at some code and architecture examples that fit a variety of NoSQL techniques, and some where SQL is a better answer. We’ll see some big data problems, little data problems, and a bunch of new and old database technologies to find whatever it takes to solve the problem.  By the end you’ll hopefully know more NoSQL, and maybe even have a few new tricks with SQL, and what’s more how to choose the right tool for the job.
MongoDB or the C# developer	100	Don't miss the NoSQL revolution!  A practical introduction to MongoDB, what it’s all about, why you should consider using it, and how to use it with your C# applications. MongoDB is the most widely used NoSQL document database, and supports a wide range of use cases and features.  This talk will be full of real examples, key gotchas you might face with real world Mongo development, and a good look at a powerful, fast new document database option from a .NET perspective.
Get you Big Data on with HDInsight	200	HDInsight is Microsoft’s Hadoop offering hosted in the Azure cloud.   This session is a quick introduction to HDInsight, and a guide to some of the features you get and where to find them. We’ll look at how you create and manage clusters and how to get data sets into the system, and some basic querying with Hive and Pig.  We'll also introduce ways to make the best of existing SQL, .NET or Java skills in the brave new world of distributed computing and Big Data with Hadoop.
Riding the Elephant: Hadoop 2.0	200	Hadoop is about much more than MapReduce these days.   This session introduces the power of YARN and how you can write applications on top of it, as well as some of the new capabilities it brings to Hadoop which make it a powerful operating systems for your data.  We will cover both what the community is doing, and how established tools like Hive and MapReduce have benefitted from YARN, as well as how you can use this new platform to write and deploy new kinds of applications on a Hadoop cluster.  We'll also take a look at new execution frameworks appearing around Hadoop, and runaway successes like Spark. 
Loose-coupling with event-driven Javascript	200	With the rise of richer Javascript frameworks, more developers are leveraging the power of the browser to build ever more usable apps. Yet many don't yet appreciate the power this environment affords - event-driven approaches together with service-oriented principles can dramatically reduce coupling across both client and server sides. Join Udi for an in-depth design session taking a regular grid-based UI and decomposing it into loosely-coupled services.
Extending Team Foundation Server... Just Right	200	This session provides a deep-dive into Team Foundation Server and common key extensions that enterprises perform to improve their application lifecycle. Attendees will learn how to overcome common challenges when migrating TFS data and how to perform advanced work item customization, use the TFS plugin model and the new API for Visual Studio Online. Along the way we will share tips and proven practices. Attendees will also gain insight to the effort and costs involved with extending TFS and when it is appropriate and valuable to do so.

The Real Time Web with ASP.NET SignalR	200	The days of your web site just responding to requests as they have done for twenty years now are over.  SignalR is the foundation towards a modern web where servers and clients communicate in real time.  This opens up the scenarios you've seen in demo after demo: the chat app.  But so much more is possible now!  Join Chris as he walks you through the basics of how easy it is to use SignalR.  But then take a step further into advanced scenarios that show how you can use this framework to deliver real-time data updates of status, simulations, games and much more.  Your clients update as the changes happen.  SignalR is amazing because you can host it in trusty IIS or in the cloud with Azure, or ANYWHERE thanks to self-hosting.  Once you open your mind to self-hosting, many interesting possibilities open up.  SignalR is amazing because of it's support for many clients besides your web browser.  With .NET, Android, and iOS support, true multiplatform networking is possible.  It works.  It's awesome.  A good working knowledge of building ASP.NET applications with C# is a great foundation for this talk.  Some basic understanding of JavaScript in the client is helpful as well.
